dice-keygen
===========

A command line app that prompts the user to enter inputs from coin flips, or 4, 8, or 16-sided dice and turns them into a hexadecimal string. Prompted by my own desire to create a cryptographically secure Bitcoin private key offline using dice, and my unhappiness with relying on SHA-256 to produce truly random output, as "dice-wallet" does.

Build instructions:

    gcc -o keygen keygen.c -std=c99

If you are using this utility to create a Bitcoin private key, specify a bit length of at most 256 when prompted. Also, make sure that the generated hexadecimal string is not larger than `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141`, which is the maximum value that can be turned into a Bitcoin private key, according to [the wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key#Range_of_valid_private_keys).


## Bitcoin Examples

Getting a Bitcoin address and importable private key (WIF) from a 256-bit private key using [pycoin](https://github.com/richardkiss/pycoin) (cross-platform):

    $ python
    >>> from pycoin.key import Key
    >>> k = Key(secret_exponent=0xFFFF562F8F9A961E158BDE2D4CCD2A64BB1D923208939714675BFAB28BBAF2A3)
    >>> print k.address()

    >>> print k.wif()

**NOTE:** As of 2014-09-25, I've switched the endianness of the key generated by the dice rolls and changed the scheme for handling any "extra" bits generated by your RNG. This *should* be of no consequence to anyone since this utility is meant to product random strings, but I'm pointing it out in this push because it *may* be of consequence to you if you've been using this tool for something other than its intended purpose.
