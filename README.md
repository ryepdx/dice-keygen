dice-keygen
===========

A command line app that prompts the user to enter inputs from coin flips, or 4, 8, or 16-sided dice and turns them into a hexadecimal string. Prompted by my own desire to create a cryptographically secure Bitcoin private key offline using dice, and my unhappiness with relying on SHA-256 to produce truly random output, as "dice-wallet" does.

Build instructions:

    gcc -o keygen keygen.c
